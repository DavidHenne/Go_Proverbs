Those who are good at winning, don't usually fight.

Those who are good at making shape don't usually fight.
zhang, 1078 AD
Never be too sure about your plan, and always doubt your ability to kill your opponent's stones.
zhong-pu liu, 1078 AD
Fighting must not be the key to go, it should be reserved as your last resource.
zhong-pu liu, 1078 AD
If you cannot succeed, then die gloriously
Chinese proverb
Go is essentially a form of harmony. Go in the 21st century will have to be go of the 'harmony of the six points - the four quarters, the above and the below.' As in life we will need to view the whole rather than the part. Japanese go has focused too heavily on the local (joseki) rather than the whole for 300 years. The reason the Chinese and Koreans are overtaking the Japanese is that they are closer to achieving this whole-board view.
Go Seigen, 9p, 1994
When your opponent is thick, you must also become thick.
Otake Hideo, 9p
In opponents' sphere of influence, avoid sharp conflict, don't move too deep
Otake Hideo, 9p
5 lines for extension in front of shimari
Yang Yilun, 7p
To invade, need 20 points in open area; otherwise, keshi is best.
Yang Yilun, 7p
Go is a game of chance where the strong player is he who renders circumstances favorable with tricks.
Audouard, Pierre
Everything happens on a grid-engraved board with black and white pieces, but if that's all you see then you don't know Go.
Audouard, Pierre
The game plays itself, the players don't control it.
Audouard, Pierre
There are possible things, impossible things, and things that happen. Sometimes things happen that were impossible.
Audouard, Pierre
The possibility or impossibility of an event results logically from the rules.
Audouard, Pierre
From the way the players perceive what can happen and what shouldn't happen springs what happens.
Audouard, Pierre
The nature of a game comes from what is played, but it's the sensitivity to the possible and the impossible that gives it value.
Audouard, Pierre
(A shicho works or doesn't work, but sometimes you don't see it, you don't play it). The possible and the impossible are visible and invisible. What happens is always what you see, what is played.
Audouard, Pierre
Territory really exists only in the end.
Audouard, Pierre
There are lines, like roots, that plunge into the stone and shatter it.
Audouard, Pierre
The intersection is rarely neutral.
Audouard, Pierre
The stone in the bowl is idiotic.
Audouard, Pierre
There are players who clack down ridiculous moves. Certain others place their moves with crisp, dry contact, like bones cracking. Still others drop their stones with a soft sound.
Audouard, Pierre
In the sound of the stone your can hear its purpose.
Audouard, Pierre
To emphasize the lack of determination in his moves, one speaks of chance.
Audouard, Pierre
One is never aware enough of the violence in go.
Audouard, Pierre
You have to like to win, and to learn to recognize the errors that gave you the victory.
Audouard, Pierre
Sometimes an idiotic stone loafs about the goban.
Audouard, Pierre
Does white await black's errors? Certainly, in two ways: either he makes clean, clear, dangerous moves; or he makes confusing, twisted moves that are just as dangerous. The adequate answers are always difficult to find.
Audouard, Pierre
If black doesn't pile up enough errors to lose, then it will soon be time to lower the handicap.
Audouard, Pierre
Very few good moves are played.
Audouard, Pierre
There is a time and a space which are the same in all go games: the alternating of black and white, and the intersections.
Audouard, Pierre
This time and this space have certain properties, and for a long time, to progress means to become familiar with them.
Audouard, Pierre
You must incessantly question yourself about this time and this space.
Audouard, Pierre
The ax's handle rots while the mind lives to the rhythm of the stones.
Audouard, Pierre
Territory is a closed space where time no longer exists. The transformation around it slowly alter it, and sometimes it cracks open like a rotten egg at the least shock.
Audouard, Pierre
Beginner's games are surprising, often incoherent and incomprehensible. When you improve, your game gains in consistency but flirts with stupidity: you become satisfied with truisms and mechanical movements, you try to obtain a feeling for clearness and style the easy way.
Audouard, Pierre
You can hide nothing on the goban.
Audouard, Pierre
Everything would seem to be possible in go. Like pulling a rabbit, by a magical move, out of a hat.
Audouard, Pierre
(Any move that follows the rules is legal). Possibilities differ according to strength.
Audouard, Pierre
Josekis are not fixed, definitive things. They indicate the moments when everything can change.
Audouard, Pierre
Learning josekis by heart is useless if you don't try departing from them.
Audouard, Pierre
Go is not a blocking game, it's a game of action.
Audouard, Pierre
Every move brings change.
Audouard, Pierre
There are players who don't accept exchanges: they play many moves that perpetuate a previous state of the game.
Audouard, Pierre
Error is one of the sources of transformation.
Audouard, Pierre
There is a time for doing things.
Audouard, Pierre
You must always consider the circumstances. Nothing is identical, yet things repeat.
Audouard, Pierre
Nothing requires doing this or that, but necessity exists.
Audouard, Pierre
To do or not to do something is not determined by what is done in general, any more than by what is necessary. Doing or not doing something is determined by what you want, and to want in go is to want to win.
Audouard, Pierre
Contesting, destabilizing, and threatening are sources of transformation.
Audouard, Pierre
Balance is not what players strive for, and if it does arise, it is in spite of them.
Audouard, Pierre
It is difficult to know exactly what you are doing.
Audouard, Pierre
More haste less speed.
Fairbairn, John
If White takes all four corners, Black should resign; if Black takes all four corners, Black should also resign.
Kent, David
Make a fist before striking

Proverbs do not apply to White.
